# python-newsfeed

## Description:
This app is a MVC structured tech-blog with a backend built mostly with Python. This structure is strikingly similar to an all javascript MVC app. This app utilizes user login, sessions, encrypts the password stored, and allows the user to post a title with a link, comment on said post, edit said post, delete said post, and upvote said post. The db is mySQL locally, using jawsDB in heroku in production.

## Technologies Utilized:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python
- pip
- Jinja templating
- Flask for local server testing
- bcrypt for password encryption
- mySQL, SQLAlchmey, PyMySQL and Gunicorn for DB, locally and in production
- dotenv
- Heroku for deployment

## Use
- When installing dependencies locally, ensure you are in a virtual environment, pip installs dependencies globally otherwise!
